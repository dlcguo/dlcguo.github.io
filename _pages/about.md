Hi! I'm Daniel, an undergraduate studying Computer Science @ CMU.

My current interests lie in computer vision methods for novel-view synthesis, with a focus on 3D Gaussian splatting. I am fortunate to be a part of the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/), advised by postdoc [Tal Daniel](https://taldatech.github.io/).

Besides coding, my interests include traveling and surfing. Some of my favorite spots so far have been the Jeonpo Cafe Street in Busan, South Korea; Honokohau Falls in Maui, Hawaii; and the Hubin business district in Hangzhou, China.

Here, I'll write about personal projects and topics I think are interesting, as well as post course reviews.

Feel free to reach me by email for any reason at dguo3 [at] cs [dot] cmu [dot] edu.
